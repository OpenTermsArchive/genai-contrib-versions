Llama API Data Commitments
==========================

Meta’s [responsible innovation principles](https://about.meta.com/metaverse/responsible-innovation/) serve as the foundation for all our work. These principles are specifically crafted to protect people’s privacy so they feel empowered to explore, connect and engage with our products.Meta does not train its AI models on Llama API Customer Content or Customer Data.

*   •Customer Data comprises your account data, roles, and profile fields.
*   •Customer Content comprises both the inputs you submit to the model (prompts) and the outputs you receive based on your inputs (model responses).

Your Customer Content and Customer Data are used only:

1.  To provide Llama API services.
2.  To understand how our services are used.
3.  To ensure adherence to the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://llama.developer.meta.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
4.  To comply with legal obligations.

Your Customer Content and your Customer Data are not used for any purposes other than those described in our permitted purposes. Customer Content and Customer Data are not used for personalization of consumer Meta Products or advertising, and personal data collected from the use of Llama API products is not used to personalize ads.Your Customer Content and Customer Data are logically separated except when shared to enforce the AUP, to facilitate payments, or to comply with other legal or regulatory requirements. Your Customer Content and Customer Data are always stored subject to strict access controls, and Meta will not sell any customer or user data as defined in the Terms of Service.

Encryption


------------

All data transmitted between Llama API and backend servers is encrypted with the industry-standard TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 protocols.Meta encrypts Customer Content and specific Customer Data when it is stored at rest, except in limited circumstances as described below. We encrypt your data at rest before it is persisted in storage. Specifically, this data is encrypted at rest using strong symmetric encryption algorithms such as ChaCha20-Poly1305 (XChaPoly) and AES-GCM.All Customer Content–see examples below–is encrypted when it’s stored at rest, except when required to comply with legal obligations. Examples:

*   •API “inputs” or “prompts”
*   •API “outputs” or “responses”
*   •Parameters that are added in API code, including configuration parameters

The specific Customer Data listed below are encrypted when stored at rest, except (i) when required to comply with legal obligations, (ii) to ensure adherence to our Acceptable Use Policy, or (iii) when customers submit this information to interact with customer support.

*   •User profile/account information:
*   •Name
*   •Role/Permission
*   •Location
*   •Mobile phone number, except when used to send an SMS message to the person
*   •Email address, and email addresses of invited collaborators except when used to send an email notification to the person
*   •Date of birth

Payment Data


--------------

Meta processes all payment card data according to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Payment card numbers are securely stored, encrypted at rest, and stored separately from your profile data. The data provided to facilitate payments within Llama API is used only to provide billing services and is never used for personalization of consumer Meta Products or advertising.

Meta’s investments in Security


--------------------------------

Meta performs regular security and vulnerability testing to assess whether key controls are properly implemented and effective. Meta has a vulnerability management program that includes definition of roles and responsibilities, dedicated ownership of vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment and patch deployment.Meta’s security team is responsible for the detection, triage and remediation of vulnerabilities in Meta’s hardware and software. Meta leverages various tools to detect security bugs in its code base, as well as in open-source and third-party code, in order to mitigate or fix security bugs before they make it into shipped Meta’s products and impact our customers.Llama API benefits from Meta’s commitment to the security of your data which manifests through the monitoring, controls and measures we have in place to pre-empt or respond to security risks.

Managing the security lifecycle


---------------------------------

Finally, Meta has established and will maintain an Information Security Management System (ISMS) designed to implement industry-standard information security practices. Meta’s ISMS is designed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, use, loss or alteration of Customer Data.Meta has a security incident response plan for monitoring, detecting and handling possible incidents. The plan includes the definition of roles and responsibilities, communication protocols and post mortem reviews, including root cause analysis and remediation plans. Meta monitors the service for any security breaches and malicious activity. The monitoring process and detection techniques are designed to detect security incidents according to relevant threats and ongoing threat intelligence.

Meta partners with and serves respected businesses around the world.

Examples of why we collect and receive information
--------------------------------------------------

### Security of our Products

For example, we collect information to monitor attempted attacks on our systems, such as overloading our servers with traffic. Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F463983701520800%2F%3Fhelpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.

### Safety and integrity

We can take action according to our Community Standards against someone without an account interacting with Meta Products. For example, we can share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.

### Advertising

For example, you may also see ads for the [Meta Company Products](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmeta-company-products%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) shown through [Meta Audience Network](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F119468292028768%2F%3Fhelpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) when you visit other apps if we can’t recognize you as a registered user of the Meta Products.

### Performance

For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.

For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or payment information.

We also collect information you provide when you:

*   Create your avatar
*   Fill out a form
*   Contact us

What we collect from our camera feature
---------------------------------------

José likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo he’s about to take, we collect information from the camera so we can apply the effect to his photo.

How filters, effects, masks and avatars work
--------------------------------------------

If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.

What we collect from voice-enabled features
-------------------------------------------

Ren tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.

*   Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created
*   Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent

Across Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta’s generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fgenai%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange).

We collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:

*   Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information you or others share with or send to AI at Meta
*   Responses and other information you receive from AI at Meta. Sometimes these are provided with the help of our [AI integrations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange%234.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)
*   Actions you ask AI at Meta to take, like customizing the content or ads you see
*   Feedback you give to AI at Meta about its responses

For example, we log:

*   What apps, posts, videos, ads, games, Shops and other content you view or interact with on our Products

Device signals include GPS, Bluetooth signals, nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and cell towers.

For example, if you give us permission to access your device’s camera roll, we collect metadata. This metadata is from and about your photos and videos and includes the date and time they were made. We use this to do things like remind you when you have new photos to upload.

Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

Information about your network and connection includes:

*   The name of your mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP)
*   Language
*   Time zone
*   Mobile phone number
*   IP address
*   Connection and download speed
*   Network capability
*   Information about other devices that are nearby or on your network
*   Wi-Fi hotspots you connect to using our Products

We use [information across your accounts on our Products](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fhelp%2Faccounts-center%2FInformation-used-across-accounts%2F%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.5-UsingInformationAcrossOur) to:

If you add accounts to the same [Accounts Center](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F943858526073065%2F%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.5-UsingInformationAcrossOur), we also use your information to offer [connected experiences](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F509817036774018%2F%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.5-UsingInformationAcrossOur) and improve your experiences across accounts.

[Manage accounts](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Faccountscenter.facebook.com%2Faccounts%2F=)

One reason we use your information across [devices\[40\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.1-WhyWeUseInformation%23annotation-40) is to help us give you a more personalized experience. For example, we might show you an ad on your phone, and later you might use your laptop to click on the ad and buy the product. By combining that information across your devices, we can understand what ads are relevant to you and help businesses measure how well their ad performed.

### Examples of when we use manual review

*   Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies and keep content that doesn’t break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf).
*   When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsafety%2Fwellbeing%2Fsuicideprevention%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.
*   We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.

### Who reviews this information

Our reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F111814505650678%3Fref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) or for a trusted [service provider\[41\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf%23annotation-41). We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.

[Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fpolicies%2Fimproving%2Fprioritizing-content-review%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) about how Meta prioritizes content for manual review.

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmeta-products%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

Your activity on our Products
-----------------------------

For example, William checks into a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.

Your activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe store or in an online chat with a shoe seller. The seller shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.

Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.

If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her [Advertisers setting](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fadpreferences%2Fadvertisers%3Fentry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur). Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [Ad preferences](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fadpreferences%2Fad_settings%3Fentry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).

Topics we think you might be interested in
------------------------------------------

For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music."

Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.

Jon can manage his interests in his [ad topics](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fadpreferences%2Fad_topics%3Fentry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).

Your connections
----------------

For example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.

We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

Personalizing ads for you and others
------------------------------------

For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.

Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.

For example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you.

A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

For example we can:

*   Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product
*   Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you
*   Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products

For example, if you follow your favorite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that team’s Page on Facebook.

Devices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.

A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

People and accounts you share and communicate with
--------------------------------------------------

When you share and communicate using our Products, you can sometimes [choose the audience\[43\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou%23annotation-43) for what you share.

When you interact with people or businesses, they can see:

For example, the audience you choose can see when you:

*   Share a post you’ve written
*   Share a photo or video
*   Create a story
*   Share a news article
*   Add information to your profile

People you interact with can see what you send to them. So if you send a person or a business a message on Messenger or Instagram, that person or business can read your message.

People and businesses can also see some of your activity on our Products. This includes when you:

*   Comment on or react to others’ posts
*   Engage with ads or other sponsored or commercial content, like by commenting or liking

Some accounts are [supervised\[44\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou%23annotation-44). When you interact with a supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information. This can include information like your username, profile picture and if the supervised user blocked you. On some Products, the supervised user can let their parent or guardian know if they reported you.

Content others share or reshare about you
-----------------------------------------

People in your audience can view your content and can choose to share it with others outside your audience, on and off our Products. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends, they can download, screenshot or reshare it with anyone, on, across or off our Products.

When you comment on a post or react to a photo, your comment or reaction can be seen by anyone who can see the post or photo. This can include people you aren’t connected to. The person who shared the post can also change their audience at any time after you’ve interacted with it.

When others interact with [AI at Meta](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fgenai%3Fentry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr), they can share information about you, including [messages and content you have shared\[45\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr%23annotation-45).

We automatically log when you receive a request from an integrated partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram Ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your information has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your Apps and Websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

When you interact with someone else’s content on an integrated partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the integrated partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How integrated partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information. In some cases, they use a separate service provider to receive and process your information.

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmeta-products%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

On Facebook, the audience can be made up of:

*   The public, including people on and off Facebook
*   Your friends and other connections, such as the friends of people you tag
*   A customized list of people
*   Yourself
*   The members of a single community, such as a group

On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account. With a [private account](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F448523408565555%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn), only followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don’t have an account. You can restrict the audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

[Audience settings](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Flogging%2F%3Ftarget=POLICY_PLATFORM_LINK_COLLECTION%3AAUDIENCE_SETTINGS&element=privacy_policy_list_cell&containing_element_id=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmbasic.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Fprintable%2F%3Flink_dialog%3DAUDIENCE_SETTINGS%26entry%3D0%26entry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn)

### Audience settings are different from app permissions

Your audience settings are different from the permissions you give to individual apps and websites to access your information. [Read our policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn%233.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn) about how you may share information with integrated partners.

Across Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta’s generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fgenai%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange).

We collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:

*   Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information you or others share with or send to AI at Meta
*   Responses and other information you receive from AI at Meta. Sometimes these are provided with the help of our [AI integrations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange%234.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)
*   Actions you ask AI at Meta to take, like customizing the content or ads you see
*   Feedback you give to AI at Meta about its responses

You can visit your [privacy settings](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsettings%3Ftab=privacy&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A3.ex.5-SearchEnginesYouCan) to control whether search engines can show your profile or public photos and videos in search results outside of Meta. Some public content might still be accessible through search engines, for example:

*   If you post with your audience or profile set to Public,
*   If you post on public Pages or accounts, depending on the settings of that account,
*   If your public content is reshared by a professional account on Instagram.

A partner who uses technologies that help you make a connection to them through our Products, including plugins, login, checkout experiences, instant games, and other such integrations

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer automatically receives information about your Like on their article.

### When you share your friends list

If you use Facebook Login to log into an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:

*   They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can’t access nonpublic information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
*   You’ll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don’t want to share your friends list with an app, or don’t want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.

### When your friends share their friends list

Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your friends can’t use Facebook Login to share nonpublic information about you.

How do we share information with third parties?
===============================================

Highlights
----------

We share certain information with:

*   Advertisers who show ads on our Products
*   Businesses we hire to market our Products for us
*   Businesses we hire to do things like offer customer service or conduct surveys
*   Researchers who use it to do things like innovate, advance technology, or improve people’s safety

We don’t sell your information, and we never will.

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require [partners\[50\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare%23annotation-50) and other [third parties\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare%23annotation-51) to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers
-------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads and commercial content. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad or commercial content. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork%23annotation-52).

Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:

*   Ads and commercial content people engaged with, if any
*   When people engaged with ads and commercial content
*   Where that ad or commercial content was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

We also confirm which ads or commercial content you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[53\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork%23annotation-53)

### Audience Network publishers and their vendors

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

*   How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
*   Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F119468292028768%3Fref=shareable&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[53\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork%23annotation-53).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our [Products\[54\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur%23annotation-54), like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.

To provide these services, we use the [information we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur%231-WhatInformationDoWe) about you. We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things like users’ experience with such content, products and services.

These reports aggregate information like:

*   How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services
*   The [general demographics and interests\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur%23annotation-52) of the people who interacted with it
*   How people use our partners’ products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks

Advertisers also receive other information. [Read our Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur%234.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[55\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods%23annotation-55), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[56\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods%23annotation-56), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

*   Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
*   Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
*   Any information required by applicable regulation
*   Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you make a purchase from an Instagram shop using checkout, the shop will receive information to complete your transaction. This may include your order items, your contact details and shipping information. If the shop uses a payment services provider, such as PayPal, to facilitate the transaction, the provider will receive the transaction amount, a transaction description (to appear on your credit card statement) and your payment card information, such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date and billing address. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F357872324807367%2F%3Fentry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods) about payments on Instagram.

Integrated partners
-------------------

When you choose to use integrated partners’ products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity. [Read the Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.8-IntegratedPartnersWhenYou%233.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our [measurement vendors\[57\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.10-MeasurementVendors%23annotation-57), who aggregate or compile it to provide their reports.

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with [marketing vendors\[58\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.11-MarketingVendors%23annotation-58). For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.

Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:

*   Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
*   Tracking and categorizing your online and mobile app activity
*   Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

[Learn more\[59\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.11-MarketingVendors%23annotation-59) about how to manage the Meta ads you see off our Products.

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

*   Investigating suspicious activity
*   Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
*   Facilitating payments
*   Providing customer support
*   Improving the functionality of our Products
*   Providing technical infrastructure services
*   Analyzing how our Products are used
*   Conducting research and surveys
*   Marketing and promoting our Products

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

*   Our business or mission
*   Social good. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fdataforgood.facebook.com%2F%3Fentry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide).
*   Technological advancement
*   Safety and security on our Products
*   Public interest
*   Health and well-being

When sharing information with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fresearchtools%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide) about the privacy-safe research we support.

AI integrations
---------------

Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. For example, that means if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer. That's why we work with other selected partners, like search engine providers. We sometimes share certain information with these partners so we can bring you the most relevant information.

[Learn more about how we share your information with these selected partners](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdialog%2Fai-partners%3Fentry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)

We also share information with other [third parties\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare%23annotation-51) in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare%2310-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, in some cases we’ll give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, but only as the law allows.

A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example, whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.

You can see the “interests” assigned to you in your [Ad preferences](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fads%2Fpreferences%2F%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A4.ex.4-GeneralDemographicsAndInterests) and remove them if you want.

The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:

*   Were women
*   Were between the ages of 25 and 34
*   Clicked on the ad from their phone

For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information you provided.

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmeta-products%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

### How long does it take to delete your information?

If you request that we delete your account or content, it may take up to 90 days to delete your information after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. After the information is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery.

If you leave your deleted content in your trash on Facebook or your Recently Deleted folder on Instagram, the deletion process will begin automatically in 30 days. Or you can start the deletion process right away by deleting the content from your trash or Recently Deleted folder.

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

Highlights
----------

*   We keep information for as long as we need it to provide a feature or service
*   But you can request that we delete your information
*   We’ll delete that information unless we have to keep it for something else, like for legal reasons

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

*   If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[66\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe%23annotation-66).
*   The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[67\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe%23annotation-67).
*   How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[68\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe%23annotation-68).
*   If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our Policy\[69\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe%23annotation-69) about when we may preserve your information.

For example, we keep profile information, photos you’ve posted (and not deleted) and security information for the lifetime of your account.

And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your [activity log](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F0%2Fallactivity%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.1-IfWeNeedIt) or delete your account. Once you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be [deleted\[70\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.1-IfWeNeedIt%23annotation-70).

But even if you don’t clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search we delete information about that search that isn’t necessary to show you your search history, like information about the device you were using, or your location.

The feature we use it for, and how that feature works
-----------------------------------------------------

For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves the chat, and Cynthia will see the message only the first time she opens the chat thread.

After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it’s deleted after 14 days.

For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for:

*   A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
*   A governmental investigation
*   A legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

Your information, including financial transaction data related to purchases or money transfers made on our Products, may be preserved and accessed for a longer time period if it’s related to any of the following:

*   A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
*   A governmental investigation
*   An investigation of possible violations of our terms or policies
*   To prevent harm
*   For safety, security and integrity purposes
*   To protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products
*   If it’s needed in relation to a legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

[See some examples\[71\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.3-WhyWeMayPreserve%23annotation-71).

In some cases, we may preserve your information based on the above reasons even after you request deletion of your account or some of your content. We may also preserve information from accounts that have been disabled and content that has been removed for violations of our terms and policies.

To delete your information, you can:

*   **Find and delete specific information.** We offer tools you can use to delete certain information. For example, you can use Delete buttons to delete content you’ve posted to your account. You can also use tools like [activity log](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Flogging%2F%3Ftarget=POLICY_PLATFORM_LINK_COLLECTION%3AACTIVITY_LOG&element=privacy_policy_inline_text&containing_element_id=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F0%2Fallactivity%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr%26should_load_landing_page%3D1) on Facebook to send content to the trash in bulk.

*   **Permanently delete your account.** If you delete your account on [Facebook](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F224562897555674%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr) or [Instagram](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F370452623149242%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr), we delete your information, including the things you’ve posted, such as your photos and status updates, unless we need to keep it as described in ["How long do we keep your information?"](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr%238-HowLongDoWe) Once your account is [permanently deleted](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F250563911970368%2F%3Fref=dp&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A6.ex.2-DeleteYourInformationOr) you won’t be able to reactivate it, and you won’t be able to retrieve information, including content you’ve posted.

### How long does it take to delete your information?

If you request that we delete your account or content, it may take up to 90 days to delete your information after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. After the information is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery.

If you leave your deleted content in your trash on Facebook or your Recently Deleted folder on Instagram, the deletion process will begin automatically in 30 days. Or you can start the deletion process right away by deleting the content from your trash or Recently Deleted folder.

### To respond to a legal request

For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.

How do we transfer information?
===============================

Highlights
----------

*   Because we connect people all around the world, we need to transfer information all around the world, too
*   When we do this, we follow international regulations to keep your information safe

Why is information transferred to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------

We share the [information we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred%231-WhatInformationDoWe) globally, both internally across our offices and data centers, and externally with our [partners\[72\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred%23annotation-72), [measurement vendors\[73\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred%23annotation-73), [service providers\[74\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred%23annotation-74) and other [third parties\[75\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred%23annotation-75). Because Meta is global, with users, partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including:

*   So we can operate and provide the services stated in the terms of the [Meta Product\[76\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.1-WhyIsInformationTransferred%23annotation-76) you’re using and this Policy. This includes allowing you to share information and connect with your family and friends around the globe.
*   So we can fix, analyze and improve our Products

Where is information transferred?
---------------------------------

Your information will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:

*   Places we have infrastructure or data centers, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, among others
*   Countries where Meta Company Products are available
*   Other countries where our partners, vendors, service providers and other third parties are located outside of the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Policy

How do we safeguard your information?
-------------------------------------

We rely on [appropriate mechanisms\[77\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A9.subpage.3-HowDoWeSafeguard%23annotation-77) for international data transfers.

We also make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place whenever we transfer your information. For example, we encrypt your information when it’s in transit over public networks to protect it from unauthorized access.

A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

A third party that creates reports to help advertisers understand how their content and ads are performing. These reports also measure whether people took an action after seeing an ad.

A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmeta-products%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call "Products."

We rely on appropriate mechanisms for international data transfers. For example, for [information we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A9.ex.2-MechanismsWeUseFor%231-WhatInformationDoWe):

*   We utilize [standard contractual clauses](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F566994660333381%3Fref=dp&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A9.ex.2-MechanismsWeUseFor) approved by the European Commission and by other relevant authorities.
*   We rely on determinations from the European Commission, and from other relevant authorities, about whether other countries have [adequate levels of data protection.](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Finfo%2Flaw%2Flaw-topic%2Fdata-protection%2Finternational-dimension-data-protection%2Fadequacy-decisions_en%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A9.ex.2-MechanismsWeUseFor)
*   We use equivalent mechanisms under applicable laws that apply to data transfers to the United States and other relevant countries.

How do we respond to legal requests, comply with applicable law and prevent harm?
=================================================================================

Highlights
----------

*   Sometimes we have to provide information to respond to legal requests when necessary
*   If there’s a law that says we need to keep your information for some reason, we need to comply with it. So we’ll keep information to obey that law.
*   We also sometimes keep information that we think will help prevent or stop bad activity, either on our Products or in the world

We access, preserve, use and share your information:

*   In response to legal requests, like search warrants, court orders, production orders or subpoenas. These requests come from [third parties\[78\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A10-HowDoWeRespond%23annotation-78) such as civil litigants, law enforcement and other government authorities. [Learn more\[79\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A10-HowDoWeRespond%23annotation-79) about when we respond to legal requests.
*   In accordance with applicable law
*   To promote the safety, security and integrity of [Meta Products\[80\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A10-HowDoWeRespond%23annotation-80), users, employees, property and the public.

A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

We respond to legal requests where we’re required by law to do so, and at times where we're not compelled by law, but a response:

*   May affect users in that jurisdiction, and
*   Is consistent with internationally recognized standards including, for example, our [Corporate Human Rights Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F04%2FFacebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A10.ex.1-WhenWeRespondTo).

In some cases, we may preserve your information based on the above reasons even after you request deletion of your account or some of your content. We may also preserve information from accounts that have been disabled and content that has been removed for violations of our terms and policies.

For example, if you unlawfully collect and use Facebook user data, we may share your information to defend ourselves against claims or in litigation.

For example, if you post threatening or harmful content, we may share your information across the Meta Companies to protect ourselves and others. This can include blocking your access to certain features or disabling your account across the Meta Companies.

### To respond to a legal request

For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.

Our ads system works in the following way:

*   **We use your information to determine the ad interests most relevant to you.** We try to predict your ad interests based on the information we have, including any choices you've made in Ad preferences.
*   **Advertisers tell us which audience they want to reach based on who they think will be most interested.** This can include things like age, gender, location where advertisers want to show their ad or interests, such as women, based in Dublin, who like golf.
*   **We review the potential ads that we could show you to identify the most relevant ones.** Our ads system automatically reviews all the potential ads where you might fit the audience that advertisers want to reach. For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things like whether it best achieves the advertiser’s goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads we may show you. We use different factors such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta Products.

*   **All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads.** When you see an ad on Meta Company Products, we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.

*   Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created
*   Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent

Devices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.
