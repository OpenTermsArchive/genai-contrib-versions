Number of Vendors seeking consent: 773

Use limited data to select advertising

Legitimate Interest

Consent

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).

Illustrations

*   A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
*   A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 730

Create profiles for personalised advertising

Consent

Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.

Illustrations

*   If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
*   An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 591

Use profiles to select personalised advertising

Consent

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.

Illustrations

*   An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
*   A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 593

Create profiles to personalise content

Consent

Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.

Illustrations

*   You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
*   You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 264

Use profiles to select personalised content

Consent

Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.

Illustrations

*   You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
*   You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 235

Measure advertising performance

Legitimate Interest

Consent

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

*   You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
*   You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 845

Measure content performance

Legitimate Interest

Consent

Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.

Illustrations

*   You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
*   You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 404

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources

Legitimate Interest

Consent

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

*   The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
*   An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 544

Develop and improve services

Legitimate Interest

Consent

Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.

Illustrations

*   A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
*   An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 632

Use limited data to select content

Legitimate Interest

Consent

Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).

Illustrations

*   A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
*   A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Special Purposes (3)

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors

Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.

Illustrations

*   An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 593

Deliver and present advertising and content

Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.

Illustrations

*   Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 594

Save and communicate privacy choices

The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.

Illustrations

*   When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.

**7\. THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING**

We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our online services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.

We may engage in the following:

*   •**Social Media Platforms.** We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, and other social media forums. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.
*   •**Third Party Partners**. We work with a variety of third-party partners to provide advertising services. For example, we may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at [https://google.com/ads/preferences](https://google.com/ads/preferences%2520), or by visiting NAI’s online resources at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).

Please see the **Online Ads** section of the **Control Over Your Information** section below to learn how you can opt out of interest-based advertising.

*   •**Online Ads**. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) resources and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources, at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android).

Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services. It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.

**9\. CHILDREN’S PERSONAL DATA**

Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal data from children under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal data either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal data from our systems.

If we learn that any personal data we have collected has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete that personal data.

**10\. DATA SECURITY AND RETENTION**

Despite our reasonable efforts to protect your information, no security measures are impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee “perfect security.” Any information you send to us electronically, while using the Services or otherwise interacting with us, may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to send us sensitive or confidential information.  

We retain your information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes specified in this Privacy Notice. When determining the length of time to retain your information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to continue to provide you the Services, resolve a dispute, enforce our contractual agreements, prevent harm, promote safety, security and integrity, or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products.

**11\. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES**

Our Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from the services, including the information or content contained within them. Our Privacy Notice does not apply to your browsing or other interactions on any other website or service. Activities on third party websites or services are subject to that applicable third party’s rules and policies, not ours. If you are using a third-party website or service, you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site or service before providing any personal data.

**12\. U.S. RESIDENTS**

This section supplements the other sections of this Privacy Notice and applies to you only if you are a resident of California or another U.S. state that has passed a privacy law similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”) that applies to us, and the law requires specific privacy notice disclosures. For purposes of this section, references to “**personal information**” shall include “**sensitive personal information**,” as these terms are defined under the CCPA.

**12.1 Processing of Personal Information:**

In the preceding 12 months, we collected and disclosed for a business purpose the following categories of personal information and sensitive personal information (denoted by \*) about residents:

*   •Identifiers, such as name, e-mail address and IP address
*   •Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute such as name, address and telephone number
*   •Commercial information such as records of products or services purchased
*   •Internet or other similar network activity such as Usage Data
*   •Geolocation data such as IP address
*   •Professional or employment-related information such as title of profession, employer, professional background and other information provided by you when you apply for a job with us
*   •Non-public education information collected by certain federally funded institutions such as education records that you provide when you apply for a job with us
*   •Account access credentials\* for the Services

The specific business or commercial purposes for which we have collected and disclosed your personal information and the categories of sources from which we collect your personal information are described in the section above, Collection and Use Your Information. The third parties that we have disclosed your information to are described in Section 4 (Disclosure of Your Information) above. We only use and disclose sensitive personal information for the purposes specified in the CCPA or otherwise in line with your consent. The criteria we use to determine how long to retain your personal information is described in the section above, Data Security and Retention.

**12.2 Selling and/or Sharing of Personal Information:**

**We do not “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) personal information, nor have we done so in the preceding 12 months.** Further, we do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” personal information of residents under 16 years of age.

**12.3 California Account Holders Under 18:**

Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Services and who have posted content or information available to others on the Services can request that such information be removed from the Services by contacting us at the e-mail address set forth in the section below, How to Contact Us. Such request must state that they personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the resident cannot be individually identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished the post, and archived copies of it may be stored by search engines and other parties that we do not control.

**13\. DATA TRANSFERS**

The personal information that we collect will be transferred to, stored at/processed in, or accessed from countries outside the jurisdiction in which you are based in, for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including countries in which our service providers or other third parties described in Section 4 are located. Specifically, we have servers for the Service in the US. We also have support, engineering and other teams who may support the Service, including from the United States.

We process the personal information that you provide to us by creating an account and using our Services in countries outside the relevant jurisdiction you are resident in in order to perform our contract with you (to provide you with our Services). By using the Services and acknowledging the Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to third parties (if any), which may include the cross-border transfer of your information to any country or region where we have databases or affiliates and, in particular, to the jurisdictions specified herein. For such transfers of data outside the relevant jurisdiction will use applicable safeguards, for example, for UK and EEA users, the European Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) (the “**Model Clauses**”), or any equivalent contracts issued by the relevant competent authority of the UK, as relevant, unless the data transfer is to a country that has been determined by the European Commission or the relevant UK authorities, as applicable, to provide an adequate level of protection for individuals’ rights and freedoms for their personal information. Please contact us at privacy@fireworks.ai should you wish to inquire further as to such data transfer mechanisms, including to examine a copy of the Model Clauses.

**14\. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES**

*   •**Withdrawal of Consent**.

You may choose to stop receiving personalized advertising or marketing promotions from us when using the Services by contacting us at our email address provided below.

You may exercise any of these rights by contacting us using the information provided below. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney document, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us using the information provided below. You may also request to delete your account through the settings page or by contacting us at privacy@fireworks.ai. If you delete your account, we aim to delete your personal information from our servers within 30 days.
