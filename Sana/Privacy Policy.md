Sana is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

We at Sana Labs AB, reg. no. 559060–6579, (“Sana,” "us," “we,” or "our") want you to feel safe when we process your personal data. This Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) explains how we ensure that your personal data is handled in compliance with applicable legislation and it applies to our processing of personal data, in the capacity of data controller, relating to our customers and users of our services, visitors to our websites, and to other business contacts. We use your personal data to be able to operate our business and meet our obligations and responsibilities in relation to applicable legislation and good industry practice.

If you are a user of our services, one of the following user categories applies to you:

1.  a user that signed up for our services independently in our online purchasing portal or applied for our free services including the free services we offer within the Civic Tier ("Self-Serve User”); or
2.  a user invited to use a service by a company or other entity which is a customer of ours (“User of Company Subscriber”), for example, if you are invited to use the services by your employer.
3.  you applied for a job at Sana, filled in a survey or otherwise communicate with Sana for example through email or social media platforms (“User of Communication Services”)

Please note that some of our processing of personal data differs depending on what User category applies to you, which is why we ensure to always state in our Privacy Notice if the processing only applies for a particular group of users.

We only use your personal data for the purposes specified in this Privacy Notice and not in any manner that is incompatible with those purposes.

1.  Sana’s role when processing your data

If you are a User of a Company Subscriber, we process your personal data in the capacity of data processor or service provider, when providing our services to our customer that is a company subscriber (i.e., the entity that invited you to use the service, for example, your employer).

We will endeavor to provide assistance to our customers to address any concerns you may have in accordance with the terms of our contract with such customer. Additionally, for any deidentified data that we collect from you on behalf of our customer or receive directly from a customer in our role as a data processor or service provider, we commit to processing that deidentified data only in a deidentified fashion and will not attempt to re-identify personal data.

Sana is the data controller for the processing of your personal data other than when we act as a processor or service provider on behalf of a customer that is a company subscriber, as described above. Sana is responsible for ensuring that the processing is carried out in accordance with applicable legislation.

4.  Retention of personal data

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary for the legitimate purposes for which we originally collected the data in accordance with this Privacy Notice and relevant privacy and data protection regulations. When we no longer need to store your data, we will remove it from our systems, databases, and backups. The retention time depends on the context and cannot in all cases be specified, in that case, we will provide information about the factors deciding the retention time.

If return or destruction is incidentally prohibited by a valid legal order, Sana shall take measures to inform you and block such personal data from any further processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or processing required by applicable law) and shall continue to appropriately protect the personal data remaining in its possession, custody, or control and, where any authorized sub-processor continues to possess personal data, require the authorized sub-processor to take the same measures that would be required of Sana.

For more detailed information on how long we retain your personal data in relation to our purposes of the processing, see Section 3.

7.  Your rights
    ===========
    

1.  Our responsibilities for your rights
    ====================================
    

In the capacity of data controller, we are responsible for ensuring that your personal data is processed in compliance with applicable laws and that you can exercise your rights. You may contact us at any time if you wish to exercise your rights. You will find our contact details at the end of this Privacy Notice.

We have an obligation to respond to your requests to exercise your rights within one month of receiving your request. If your request is complex or if we have received many requests, we have the right to extend this deadline to two more months. If we are unable to take the action you request within one month, we will inform you of the reason for the delay and of your right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to seek judicial remedy.

You will not be charged for requesting information, for communication, or measures that we carry out. However, if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge an administrative fee for providing the information or taking the action requested or refuse to act on your request altogether.

2.  Your rights to access, rectification, erasure, and restriction
    ==============================================================
    

As a data subject you have the following rights:

Access to your personal data. This means that you have the right to request access to the personal data that we hold about you. You also have the right to be provided, at no cost, a copy of the personal data about you that we are processing. We have the right to charge a reasonable administration fee if you request further copies. If you make a request in electronic form, e.g. via email, we will provide you with the information in a commonly used electronic format.

Rectification of your personal data. At your request or on our own initiative, we will correct, anonymize, delete or complement data that is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. You also have the right to complete any incomplete personal data if something relevant is missing.

Erasure of your personal data. You have the right to request that we delete your personal data if there is no compelling reason for us to continue processing the data. Personal data should therefore be erased if:

*   it is no longer needed for the purpose for which we collected it;
*   we process your personal data based on the consent provided by you and you withdraw your consent;
*   you object to us processing your data based on a legitimate interest assessment and we have no compelling interest that overrides your interests and rights;
*   we have processed the personal data unlawfully;
*   or we have a legal obligation to erase personal data.

However, there may be legal requirements or other compelling reasons that prevent us from immediately erasing your personal data. We will then stop processing your personal data for purposes other than in compliance with the law or where there are no compelling legitimate grounds for doing so.

In the event you would like to exercise your right for the erasure of your personal data, please use [this form](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gdpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RIGHT-TO-ERASURE-REQUEST-FORM.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1757083339617312&usg=AOvVaw2T6qY7dc-l5m-vdyFgJk7L) and send an email with the subject line “Erasure of Personal Data Request” and the completed form attached to [privacy@sanalabs.com](mailto:privacy@sanalabs.com). We will confirm receipt of the completed form and take reasonable steps to ensure you are the data subject. Upon verification, we will complete the erasure without undue delay.

Restriction of processing. This means that we temporarily restrict the processing of your data. You have the right to request restriction under certain conditions, e.g. when: you consider your data to be inaccurate and you have requested rectification as defined above, while we establish the accuracy of the data; the processing is unlawful and you do not want the data to be erased; as the personal data controller, we no longer need the personal data for our processing purposes, but you need them to be able to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim; or you have objected to processing as defined in Section 9.3.1, while waiting for us to consider whether our legitimate interests override yours.

We will take all reasonable measures possible to notify everyone who has received personal data as stated in Section 7 above if we have rectified, erased, or restricted access to your personal data after you have requested us to do so. If you request information on recipients of your personal data, we will inform you about the recipients.

Right to Object. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data if our processing is based upon legitimate interests (see Section 3 above). If you object to such processing, we will only continue to process your data if we have compelling reasons for doing so that override your interests.

If you do not wish that we use your personal data for direct marketing, you have the right to object to such processing by contacting us. We will cease to use your data for that purpose when we have received your objection.

### Right to withdraw your consent. When we need your consent in order to process your personal data, you always have the right to withdraw such consent at any time by contacting us.

### Right to data portability. You have the right to data portability. This means the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to request that these data are transferred to another personal data controller. The right to data portability only applies when the processing is being carried out by automated means and our lawful basis for processing your data is the performance of an agreement between you and us or your consent.

File a complaint. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Swedish Data Protection Authority (Sw. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) if you are not satisfied with our processing of your personal data.

*   Access the personal information we hold about you (APP 12).
*   Request correction of your personal information if it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, or misleading (APP 13).
*   Complain about our handling of your personal information. We will respond to your complaint in a timely manner. If you are not satisfied with our response, you may lodge a complaint with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) at [www.oaic.gov.au](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oaic.gov.au&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1757083339623172&usg=AOvVaw2aJMR_n3HYeakmCrXhDx_S).

We also comply with Australia’s Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme, which means we will notify you and the OAIC if a data breach is likely to result in serious harm to you.

8.  Protection of your personal data
    ================================
    

We always want you to feel confident about providing us with your personal data. We have therefore taken appropriate security measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, and erasure. Even though we work hard to protect your data, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Should a security breach occur that may materially impact you or your personal data, e.g., risk of fraud or identity theft, we will contact you to explain what action you can take to mitigate potential adverse effects of the breach.

We strongly advise you to be cautious and to protect your own personal data. You are responsible for keeping your passwords confidential and avoiding others from observing your personal data when using our services in public spaces.

9.  Collection of personal data from children
    =========================================
    

Our services are not directed to or intended for children under 18 years of age, other than the free services provided to Civic Tier users above the age of 13 years. Processing of personal data relating to children using our Civic Tier services is subject to our [Children’s Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sanalabs.com/download/legal/privacy-policy-children.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1757083339624958&usg=AOvVaw13fcBZWdj_yG7wneCNUynI). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 under any circumstance. If you have reason to believe that a child under 13 has provided personal data to Sana via the service, we ask you to contact us at [privacy@sanalabs.com](mailto:privacy@sanalabs.com). We will investigate every report and, if applicable, delete the personal data from our systems.

11.  Changes to the Privacy Notice
     =============================
     

We have the right to make changes to this Privacy Notice at any time. When we make significant changes that materially affect you, we will inform you of these changes and what they mean for you before they become effective.
