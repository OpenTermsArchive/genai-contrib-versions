4\. The Intric platform: access and basic functions
---------------------------------------------------

Intric shall provide the Customer with log-in details to an Admin Account for the Intric Platform, and thereby provide the possibility to administer and manage its use of the Intric Platform.

### 6.1 Processing of personal information

As part of delivering the Intric.AI platform, Intric will process Personal Data on behalf of the Customer.

Intric will be a data processor (Swedish. personuppgiftsbiträde) in relation to the processing of such Personal Data within the Intric.AI Platform (excluding any processing taking place within third party AI model providers).

Intric does not have the right not to sell, rent, lease or otherwise make collected Data available to third parties, except in the following situations; (i) to comply with law, regulation or regulation, or to respond to a lawful request by authorities or police, such as a court order, warrant or injunction; (ii) to investigate or prevent security threats or fraud.
