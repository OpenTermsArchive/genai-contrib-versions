We may disclose your personal information:

3.  To establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purpose of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk).
4.  In connection with events held in cooperation with an association.

Before you disclose another person’s personal information to us, you must obtain that person’s consent for both the disclosure and the processing of that personal information in accordance with this policy.

We will **not** share your personal information with third parties for their or others’ direct marketing without your explicit consent.

Security of Your Personal Information

The data you provide will be stored for as long as we deem necessary, for example, to maintain contact.

We commit to:

1.  Taking reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information.
2.  Storing all personal data you provide on secure (password- and firewall-protected) servers.

You acknowledge that the transmission of information over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.

We may occasionally make changes to this policy. Amendments and clarifications take effect immediately upon being published on the website.  
If we make significant changes, we will notify you via the email address we have registered for you, so you are aware of what information we collect and how we use it.

You are always welcome to contact us with questions or concerns. You have the right to know what personal data we process about you. You also have the right to have incorrect personal data corrected.

You may at any time:

Cookies

We use cookies and similar technologies to provide the services and features offered on our website and to give our visitors a good experience.  
By consenting to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy when you visit our website for the first time, you allow us to use cookies every time you visit our site.

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a browser and is stored by the browser.  
The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

Cookies can be either:

*   **Persistent cookies** – stored by a browser and remain valid until their set expiration date (unless deleted earlier by the user).
*   **Session cookies** – expire at the end of the user session, when the browser is closed.

Cookies typically do not contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
